## Unit tests for libcpp_test file

This week, I wrote unit tests for the libcpp_test file, which currently has all easy cases wrapped except for functions using map & other nested data structures, overloaded methods, attributes of LibCppTest class containing raw pointers, deepcopy/copy methods and class methods for operator overloading.

For writing tests I have used the [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/), a very popular unit testing package in R. It has functions for easily testing the expected function behaviour and also displays the test results in an interactive manner.

### Test Structure

In general, all the R test files can be found in the directory **Rtests** inside the main autowrap repository. All the files, which need to be tested are kept in the **test_files**, a sub-directory of **Rtests**. Please note before testing any R file, a corresponding python binding (or package) for it must exist in Rtests.

Also, these dependency R packages need to be installed : `reticulate`, `R6`, `purrr`, `plotrix` & `varhandle`.

Tests are organized hierarchically, a file contains a set of tests and each test further comprises of expectations, where an expectation describes the expected result of a function.

Below, we can see the structure of R test file for libcpp_test. We have two tests, one to test the constructors and the other for testing the functions of LibCppTest.

```
context("Testing R code generated for libcpp_test")

# load the file to test
source("./test_files/py_libcpp_test.R")

test_that("Test Copy constructors",{
		
      # create new Int, make copy (shallow)
      int_wrp <- Int$new(1)
      expect_identical(int_wrp$i_,1L)
      int_wrpcpy <- int_wrp
      expect_identical(int_wrpcpy$i_,1L)
      
      ...
}

test_that("Testing LibCppTest Processes",{

      # creating a new object of LibCppTest
      t <- LibCppTest$new()
      
      expect_equivalent(t$twist(list("hi",2)),list(2L,"hi"))

      # process
      li = list(1)
      li2 <- t$process(li)
      expect_equivalent(li,li2)
      expect_equivalent(li,list(1L,42L))
      
      ...
} 
```

### Running the tests

Currently, we can run all the test files at once and obtain the results interactively on the command line by executing the function `testthat::test_dir()` passing the relative/absolute path of **Rtests** directory.

### Going Forward

I would try to wrap the cases associated with nested data structures and write additional tests.
