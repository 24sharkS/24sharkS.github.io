## Unit testing for libcpp_test file

This week, I wrote unit tests for the libcpp_test file, which currently has all easy cases wrapped except for functions using map & other nested data structures, overloaded methods, attributes of LibCppTest class containing raw pointers, deepcopy/copy methods and class methods for operator overloading.

For writing tests I have used the [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/), a very popular unit testing package in R. It has functions for easily testing the expected function behaviour and also displays the test results in an interactive manner.

### Test Structure
In general, all the R test files can be found in the directory **Rtests** inside the main autowrap repository. All the files, for which we perform the tests are kept in the **test_files**
