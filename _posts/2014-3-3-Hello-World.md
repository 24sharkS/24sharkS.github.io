Hi! I am a sophomore student at IIIT Delhi studying B.Tech in CSB.

###

This is a demo blog for GSOC 2020.


My project for GSOC 2020 involves writing a wrapper R package for the pyopenms package which exposes the functions of C++ library OpenMS.



****The project timeline is divided into 3 phases with each one spanning roughly over a month.

The current goals and todos list can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS/projects/31).
