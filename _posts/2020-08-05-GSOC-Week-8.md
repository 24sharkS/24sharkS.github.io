### Wrapping pyOpenMS

This week, I was able to generate R6 wrappers for pyopenms library using the pxd source files which are also currently being used by pyopenms. All the R6 wrappers are being generated in a single file (**setting PY_NUM_MODULES as 1**) and the code involving import of required R packages and helper functions is generated in a separate file.

The second file must be loaded before loading the wrappers and to ensure the python module object is not null and all necessary packages are also available.
