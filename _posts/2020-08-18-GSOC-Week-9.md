This week, I worked on debugging the wrapped code and refactored the code responsible for generating the R6 fields (private, public and active) in a proper syntactical manner. Most of the bugs were mainly syntax related like missing ";" between two function declarations in the public section, missing declaration of R6 fields, etc.

For all the interface classes (**BinaryDataArray**,**Spectrum**,**** )
