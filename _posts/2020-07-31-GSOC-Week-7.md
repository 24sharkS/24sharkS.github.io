## A New Post

Continuing with the previous week's work, I wrapped the methods using nested data structures like map & vector, overloaded methods and LibCppTest attributes containing raw pointers. I wrote additional tests to check the wrappers associated with above cases.

I also did some refactoring to enable the user to pass any integer argument without the need of explicit conversion (for e.g. passing 1 instead of "1L" or "as.integer(1)"). This is because R stores any integer type number as double by default.
