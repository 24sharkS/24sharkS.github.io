## A New Post

Continuing with the previous week's work, I wrapped the methods using nested data structures like dict & list, overloaded methods and LibCppTest attributes containing raw pointers. I wrote additional tests to check the wrappers associated with above cases.

I also did some refactoring to enable the user to pass any integer argument without the need of explicit conversion (for e.g. passing 1 instead of "1L" or "as.integer(1)"). This is because R stores any integer type number as double by default.

## Wrapping python dictionary as named list in R.
Currently, dictionary is wrapped as a named list where the name(like the key in python) is confined as a character type only. This means, a key will always be stored after being casted to character and we lose information about its type. **Also, apart from the basic data types like integer, numeric and logical we cannot use any other object as name in our list as it would be impossible to convert it back to its original type unlike the primitve types**.

The below code demonstrates the conversion of a python dict as a named list in R :

```
> dict <- reticulate::py_dict(c(42L,12L),c(2.0,1.0))
> dict
{42: 2.0, 12: 1.0}
> named_list <- py_to_r(dict)
> named_list
$`42`
[1] 2

$`12`
[1] 1

> names(named_list)
[1] "42" "12"
```

We also need to be careful if the function requires a dict where the key is bytes, as reticulate does not convert byte type. For example

```
> py_builtin <- reticulate::import_builtins()
> dict <- reticulate::py_dict(c(py_builtin$bytes('foo','utf-8')),c("bar"))
> dict
{b'foo': 'bar'}
> py_to_r(dict)
> reticulate::py_to_r(dict)
$`b'foo'`
[1] "bar"


```
